# Stories110M Training Backlog

## Facet scope

Forward/backward correctness, optimizer stability, data contracts, positional encoding, resume determinism, and training evidence.

## Current-state framing

This backlog is seeded from source revision `3e29615` and the verified analysis in `reports/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`. Tasks are proposals, not proof that the cited finding remains unchanged after future edits. Hardware and historical claims require fresh evidence before closure.

## Architectural constraints

- Preserve the ANE I/O, allocation, ordering, and BLOBFILE invariants documented by the current source until a versioned replacement is approved.
- Prefer fail-closed behavior for silent-correctness and integrity risks.
- Keep portable verification separate from ANE-, asset-, and external-export-dependent evidence.
- External `ORX-*`, `G008`, `G009`, and `VXANE-G008` references are gates or provenance, not local task IDs.

## Task summary

| ID | Task | Priority | Size | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ORION-0067 | Add independent forward backward and Adam oracles | P0 | XL | ORION-0029 |
| ORION-0068 | Fail closed on missing or malformed training weights | P0 | L | ORION-0031; ORION-0052 |
| ORION-0069 | Add non-finite saturation and clamp telemetry | P1 | M | ORION-0067 |
| ORION-0070 | Resolve positional encoding and sequence-length contract | P1 | L | ORION-0067 |
| ORION-0071 | Persist exact data loader and RNG resume state | P1 | L | ORION-0050 |
| ORION-0072 | Validate dataset structure tokens and document boundaries | P0 | M | ORION-0090 |

## Sequencing guidance

Work P0 integrity and safety tasks before enabling broader operational or release claims. P1 evidence and lifecycle work follows; P2/P3 cleanup should not mask unresolved correctness gaps.

## ORION-0067 — Add independent forward backward and Adam oracles

**Status:** proposed
**Priority:** P0 — silent-correctness, security, memory/lifecycle, or claim-integrity blocker
**Size:** XL
**Dependencies:** ORION-0029
**Required capabilities/assets:** Portable/local unless a criterion explicitly requires assets or ANE hardware

### Problem and consequence

Prove every tensor/gradient/update against a pinned external reference. Without a bounded task and explicit evidence, this facet can drift or produce results that are difficult to trust.

### Scope

**In scope**
- Implement the behavior described by the outcome below in the cited facet.
- Add positive, negative, boundary, and regression evidence appropriate to the risk.
- Update normative documentation or schemas when the contract changes.

**Out of scope**
- Unrelated model architecture changes or performance tuning.
- Treating historical benchmark prose as proof of current behavior.
- Expanding support to unqualified operating systems, devices, or hostile multi-tenant use.

### Source evidence

- `compiler/frontends/stories_train.c`
- `kernels/training/stories_train.m`
- `tests/test_train_kernels.m`

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **AC-1 — Outcome:** Fixtures cover all forward taps, input/parameter gradients, RMS/embedding gradients, finite differences, and one Adam step.
- [ ] **AC-2 — Fail closed:** Invalid, missing, truncated, mismatched, out-of-range, or incompatible inputs relevant to this task are rejected before externally visible state is committed.
- [ ] **AC-3 — Regression coverage:** Existing supported behavior has an automated regression test, and the test fails against a fixture reproducing the original gap.
- [ ] **AC-4 — Diagnostics:** Failures identify the operation and affected object (such as path, tensor, layer, binding, option, or profile) without requiring private-framework log parsing.
- [ ] **AC-5 — Evidence:** Completion records the exact source revision, commands, PASS/FAIL/SKIP counts, required assets, and hardware/OS/compiler identity for non-portable verification.
- [ ] **AC-6 — Compatibility:** Any compatibility, migration, fallback, or rollback behavior is documented; no silent fallback weakens correctness.

### Verification plan

| Layer | Required verification | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Portable/source | Focused unit or static test plus the relevant portable profile | Command, exit status, assertion count, and log |
| Negative/boundary | Malformed and boundary fixtures for the original failure mode | Named fixtures and expected errors |
| Integration | Exercise the owning command/module through its public contract | End-to-end result and cleanup state |
| Hardware/numerical | When applicable, compile/eval on a qualified Apple Silicon profile and compare with an independent reference | SoC, macOS, compiler profile, assets, tolerances, observed values |
| Documentation | Validate normative docs/schema/help against implementation | Link or generated-doc check |

### Dependencies and rollout

- Blocking dependencies must be complete before this task is marked `ready` unless the task is explicitly split.
- Preserve a known-good path until replacement evidence passes.
- Close only after all mandatory acceptance criteria are checked and residual limitations are listed.
