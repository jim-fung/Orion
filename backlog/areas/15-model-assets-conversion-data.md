# Model Assets, Conversion, and Data Backlog

## Facet scope

Strict BLOBFILE library, model manifests, conversion atomics, asset locks, data acquisition, and fixed configuration provenance.

## Current-state framing

This backlog is seeded from source revision `3e29615` and the verified analysis in `reports/CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md`. Tasks are proposals, not proof that the cited finding remains unchanged after future edits. Hardware and historical claims require fresh evidence before closure.

## Architectural constraints

- Preserve the ANE I/O, allocation, ordering, and BLOBFILE invariants documented by the current source until a versioned replacement is approved.
- Prefer fail-closed behavior for silent-correctness and integrity risks.
- Keep portable verification separate from ANE-, asset-, and external-export-dependent evidence.
- External `ORX-*`, `G008`, `G009`, and `VXANE-G008` references are gates or provenance, not local task IDs.

## Task summary

| ID | Task | Priority | Size | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| ORION-0085 | Create a versioned model-package manifest | P1 | XL | ORION-0015 |
| ORION-0086 | Implement a shared strict BLOBFILE library | P0 | XL | ORION-0031 |
| ORION-0087 | Make conversion atomic and fail closed | P1 | L | ORION-0085; ORION-0086 |
| ORION-0088 | Lock Python conversion and golden dependencies | P1 | M | — |
| ORION-0089 | Add verified asset bootstrap and offline inspection | P1 | L | ORION-0085 |
| ORION-0090 | Validate TinyStories data provenance and format | P1 | M | ORION-0085; ORION-0095 |

## Sequencing guidance

Work P0 integrity and safety tasks before enabling broader operational or release claims. P1 evidence and lifecycle work follows; P2/P3 cleanup should not mask unresolved correctness gaps.

## ORION-0085 — Create a versioned model-package manifest

**Status:** proposed
**Priority:** P1 — required correctness, reliability, or evidence for a supported workflow
**Size:** XL
**Dependencies:** ORION-0015
**Required capabilities/assets:** Portable/local unless a criterion explicitly requires assets or ANE hardware

### Problem and consequence

Record source revision, config, tokenizer, converter, tensors, layouts, hashes, licenses, and compatibility. Without a bounded task and explicit evidence, this facet can drift or produce results that are difficult to trust.

### Scope

**In scope**
- Implement the behavior described by the outcome below in the cited facet.
- Add positive, negative, boundary, and regression evidence appropriate to the risk.
- Update normative documentation or schemas when the contract changes.

**Out of scope**
- Unrelated model architecture changes or performance tuning.
- Treating historical benchmark prose as proof of current behavior.
- Expanding support to unqualified operating systems, devices, or hostile multi-tenant use.

### Source evidence

- `model/`
- `core/model_registry.m`

### Acceptance criteria

- [ ] **AC-1 — Outcome:** Converters emit schema-valid manifests and strict runtime load rejects mismatch/incompleteness.
- [ ] **AC-2 — Fail closed:** Invalid, missing, truncated, mismatched, out-of-range, or incompatible inputs relevant to this task are rejected before externally visible state is committed.
- [ ] **AC-3 — Regression coverage:** Existing supported behavior has an automated regression test, and the test fails against a fixture reproducing the original gap.
- [ ] **AC-4 — Diagnostics:** Failures identify the operation and affected object (such as path, tensor, layer, binding, option, or profile) without requiring private-framework log parsing.
- [ ] **AC-5 — Evidence:** Completion records the exact source revision, commands, PASS/FAIL/SKIP counts, required assets, and hardware/OS/compiler identity for non-portable verification.
- [ ] **AC-6 — Compatibility:** Any compatibility, migration, fallback, or rollback behavior is documented; no silent fallback weakens correctness.

### Verification plan

| Layer | Required verification | Completion evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Portable/source | Focused unit or static test plus the relevant portable profile | Command, exit status, assertion count, and log |
| Negative/boundary | Malformed and boundary fixtures for the original failure mode | Named fixtures and expected errors |
| Integration | Exercise the owning command/module through its public contract | End-to-end result and cleanup state |
| Hardware/numerical | When applicable, compile/eval on a qualified Apple Silicon profile and compare with an independent reference | SoC, macOS, compiler profile, assets, tolerances, observed values |
| Documentation | Validate normative docs/schema/help against implementation | Link or generated-doc check |

### Dependencies and rollout

- Blocking dependencies must be complete before this task is marked `ready` unless the task is explicitly split.
- Preserve a known-good path until replacement evidence passes.
- Close only after all mandatory acceptance criteria are checked and residual limitations are listed.
